# ExcelMiner
Powershell script to mine Excel spreadsheets for data and dump into a nice little csv. Useful if you need to injest data from a large folder of excel sheets. I am working on a .NET version of the same thing so that you can have a more useful UI and have additional options.

NOTE: I will no longer be updating this actively as I'm working on a .NET version of the software. 


# Usage
This requires the Microsoft Access Database Engine 2010 Redist (Found here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=13255)

To use the script, use a single copy of the Excel sheet and let it make a temp.txt dump. From there, you can grab the term and line offset and make a "Terms.csv" as found included with this repo.

If anyone actually stumbles upon this and needs help using it feel free to ask.
